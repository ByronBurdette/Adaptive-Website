                    There are ten playable races in Skyrim, who will make up the majority of the player's NPC interaction. Each race has its own unique
                    strengths, abilities and powers.

                            More commonly known as High Elves, Altmer are are a tall, golden-skinned, pointy-eared race and the most strongly gifted in the
                            arcane arts of all the races. The "High" in High Elf is is often understood to mean proud or snobbish, as the Altmer generally
                            personify these characteristics, referring to other races as "lesser" and believing themselves to be direct descendants of gods.
                            They are often the subject of racism and discrimination due to their affiliation with the Thalmor. In Skyrim, Almter are given
                            bonuses to all <a href="gameplay.html#skills">skills</a> governed by the school of magic, they have have a larger pool of magic than other races and the ability to
                            briefly regenerate magic more quickly. Although it has no effect on the game, Altmer can live over three times as long as non-elf
                            races (around 300 years).

                            Argonians are oviparous, humanoid, reptilian natives of swampland. They possess a wide variety of unique aesthetic features including
                            scales, spikes, horns, ridges, feathers, sharp teeth and claws, fins, gills, and a tail. Gills allow Argonians to be the only race
                            which can breath under water. On top of water breathing, in Skyrim, Argonians are 50% more resistant to poison and diseases than
                            most other races, deal more unarmed damage than other races, exhibit bonuses to <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Lockpicking</a>,

                            More commonly known as Wood Elves, Bosmer are shorter and have light-brown skin and pointy ears. Rejecting the formalities of the
                            civilized world, the Bosmer discarded lavish living for a life in the wilderness, among nature and animals. In fact, their major
                            cities are actually located in giant walking trees that roam the forest of their homeland, and they paint their bodies to resemble
                            their forest surroundings. Because of this, many view them as barbarians. Bosmer are known to be extremely agile, quick and
                            resilient. In Skyrim, Bosmer are given bonuses to <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Archery</a>, <a href="gameplay.html#skills">

                            ability to briefly turn a wild animal into an ally. Like Altmer, Bosmer can also live to be 300 years old.

                            A race of both human and elven ancestry, Breton are considered one of the more intelligent races, known for a proficiency in
                            abstract thinking as well as their adeptness in the magical arts. Aside from their known, mixed heritage, Bretons have almost
                            no distinguishable features from those of the other human races. In Skyrim, Breton are given bonuses to <a href="gameplay.html#skills">

                            pointy ears, and glowing red eyes and like their elven cousins, Dunmer can live to be 300 years old. Dunmer are known to be strong,
                            intelligent, quick, aloof, and reserved; mostly keeping to themselves. They harbor a natural, bitter distrust and disdain for all
                            races, including other Dunmer. Dunmer are noted for their skill with a balanced integration of the sword, the bow and destruction
                            magic. In Skyrim, Dunmer are given bonuses to most <a href="gameplay.html#skills">skills</a> governed by the school of magic as
                            well as <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Light Armor</a> and <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Sneak</a>, they are 50% resistant to

                            of Cyrodiil. Imperials are also known for the discipline and training of their citizen armies, and their respect for the rule of
                            law. Though physically less imposing than the other races, the Imperials have proved to be shrewd diplomats and traders, and these
                            traits, along with their remarkable skill and training as light infantry, have enabled them to subdue all the other nations and
                            races under one Empire. In Skyrim, Imperials are given bonuses to <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Restoration</a>, <a href="gameplay.html#skills">

                            The Khajiit are a race of feline humanoids of average height, and well-known for their keen intelligence and agility. While these
                            traits make them superb thieves, acrobats and warriors, they struggle greatly attempting to use magic. In Skyrim, Kahjiit are given

                            the finest in the Empire. Orc's warrior status is complimented by a deeply ingrained warrior culture, although their society is
                            viewed by the other races as unnecessarily rough and cruel. In Skyrim, Orcs ar given bonuses to <a href="gameplay.html#skills">

                    Skyrim is the first entry in The Elder Scrolls series to include dragons, and they are the main antagonists of the game. Like other
                    <a href="characters.html#creatures">creatures</a>, dragons are unlimited in number, being generated randomly from time-to-time throughout
                    Skyrim. Dragons will attack literally any <a href="characters.html#creatures">creature</a> or <a href="characters.html#races">NPC</a>
                    they see, and they are often seen laying siege to entire villages, cities, and forts. Although large and beastly, dragons are very
                    intelligent and capable of language, of which their native tongue is said to be intrinsic to their very existence, but they are known to
                    learn all manner of languages. The dragon's language is the source of a dragon's magic; things like fire and frost breath, as well as
                    other effects. In the past, dragons tyrannically ruled over Skyrim and its surrounding regions, but when a god intervened, it blessed a
                    few men, giving them the blood of a dragon. Under normal circumstances, a dragon is immortal and cannot be killed by conventional means;
                    they can only be briefly pacified before recovering. However, a dragon can be killed by another dragon. This, along with the ability to
                    learn the language and magic of dragons, was the key which allowed those blessed with the blood of dragons to defeat most of the dragons,
                    and force the rest into hiding. The final dragon, Alduin the World Eater, was banished forward 1000 years in time using an Elder Scroll.
                    Those blessed warriors came to be known as Dragonborn. When Alduin returned 1000 years later, he set about resurrecting his slain brethren.
                    Dragons now present a constant threat, and as the last remaining Dragonborn, it is up to you to defend Skyrim from dragons and defeat their
                    progenitor, Alduin.
