                <p>
                    Armor is a type of apparel worn on the body to reduce incoming physical damage. In addition to offering protection from physical attacks,
                    armor can be enchanted to grant additional types of protection, to bolster certain skills, or to increase stats such as Stamina, Health
                    and Magic. Armor comes in several pieces which can be equipped independently of each other; these pieces are: 
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Armor</span>: covers your legs, chest and shoulders</li>
                        
                    <li><span class="highlight">Boots</span>: covers your feet and ankles</li>
                        
                    <li><span class="highlight">Gauntlets</span>: covers your hands up to your elbow</li>
                        
                    <li><span class="highlight">Helmet</span>: covers your head</li>
                        
                    <li><span class="highlight">Shield</span>: protect and block attacks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Beyond the different pieces, armor is broken up into two main types, Heavy Armor and Light Armor, both with their own associated 
                    <a href="gameplay.html#skills">skill trees</a>. The two types are further broken up by several different materials and styles, which
                    determine the quality of the armor. Higher quality armor provides better protection (but is generally heavier). Each of the two types of
                    armor come with their own advantages and disadvantages.

                        <td>Heavy Armor offers far greater protection from physical attacks, but at the cost of producing more noise,
                            making stealth more difficult, and a higher weight which reduces the player's movement speed.

                    Weapons are the primary tool for dealing physical damage. They are essential tools of survival in Skyrim, and can be bought, looted,
                    stolen, forged, or received as a reward. Skyrim offers a diverse range of weapon types which can be produced at different qualities. In
                    Skyrim, weapons are broken up into three categories where they are governed by separate skills; <a href="gameplay.html#skills">One-Handed</a>,
                    <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Two-Handed</a> and <a href="gameplay.html#skills">Archery</a>.

                        There is a HUGE list of items&mdash;magical, valuable, or mundane&mdash;available in Skyrim. These items, once collected, are added to the
                        player's inventory and sorted into specific categories depending on the item. Items can be found just about anywhere; they can be picked
                        up off the ground, looted from the dead, found in containers like barrels, boxes, sacks, dressers and chests, they can be given as gifts,
                        bought, or stolen from people, shops, houses or other buildings. Beyond armor and weapons, the player will encounter entire books and
                        notes which can be read, food and drink to be consumed, money, ingredients for making potions and more food, gems, stones, rings,
                        necklaces, clothes, ores and ingots, scrolls, keys, brooms, cups, plates, silverware, torches, etc. The list just goes on!
