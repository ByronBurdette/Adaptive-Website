                    One of the many hallmarks of the Elder Scrolls series is the ability to customize the appearance of the player character, and it
                    is the first decision that you must make when playing Skyrim. You are presented with a wide variety of options for customizing your
                    appearance; you can choose from one of the 10 <a href="characters.html#races">playable races</a>, choose your gender, change your weight,
                    skin color, eye color, hair color and style, war paint and/or tattoos (fur patterns for Khajiit), the presence of dirt, scars, facial hair
                    (for males), jewelry (for select races) and weathers/horns (Argonians only). Although you are presented with such a wide variety of options
                    for altering your appearance, the only decision that affects subsequent game play is your chosen race, as each of the races have a few of
                    their own race-specific abilities. Race will also have a minor effect on dialog as the character experiences prejudice that certain
                    individuals may have.

                    The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world, action role playing game set in either the first or third person. This means
                    that you, the player, will assume a role (Dragonborn in this case), will be free to traverse any part of Skyrim at any time,
                    and will experience the gameplay in real-time, as opposed to step-by-step, or turn based games. Skyrim is an open world environment
                    consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Although players may choose to traverse the game
                    world on foot, they may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which allows them
                    to warp to previously discovered locations (players cannot fast-travel to undiscovered locations). Fully voiced, non-player characters (NPCs)
                    populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways, although their main purpose is to serve as quest-givers, and to advance the
                    story. The bulk of Skyrim's gameplay involves traveling around Skyrim, interacting with NPCs, accepting quests and engaging in combat.
                    Combat can take place between the player and/or any number of creatures and NPCs. All participants utilize combinations of physical attacks,
                    weapons, or magic in an attempt to kill or overcome their opponent. The player's effectiveness in combat relies on the use of weapons and
                    armor, which may be bought, found and created at forges, and magic, which may be bought or unlocked by finding spell tomes. Weapons and
                    magic are assigned to each hand, allowing for dual-wielding, and can be swapped out through a quick-access menu of favorited items. During
                    combat, the player uses magic to cast spells, and stamina to use weapons. The player must juggle managing their health, magic and stamina
                    in order to stay alive and remain effective during combat.

                    A perpetual objective for players is to develop their character. Over the course of the game, players improve their character's
                    skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly among the
                    three schools of combat, magic, and stealth:

                    Video games these days have become incredibly sophisticated, and Skyrim is no exception&mdash;if not the premier poster-child of additional
                    features in a video game. Beyond the core gameplay of quests and combat, there are a myriad of activities the Dragonborn can engage in.
                    You can join and advance through multiple factions, hire body guards, steal things and become a criminal, leverage your status to make
                    guards show preferential treatment, go to jail, break out of jail, pay off criminal bounties, visit shops, craft potions, mine and smelt ore which
                    can then be used to craft, improve and enchant armor and weapons, gather ingredients, visit a tavern, rent a room, sleep, buy and
                    renovate a house, cook and eat food, chop wood, build your own house, marry (select <a href="characters.html#races">NPCs</a>), adopt
                    children, sit around, drink (even to excess), play instruments, talk to just about anyone you see and much, much more. Skyrim spares no
                    expense for those looking to immerse themselves in a deeper role-playing experience.
